## DECA Lab Challenge
**Task:** To create a multiplier via hardware and to show that it has higher efficiency than software

**Limitations:** Use no more than 64 full adders

**PDF showing overall design process:** [challenge2.pdf](https://github.com/zenbean/lab2-challenge/blob/main/challenge2.pdf "challenge2.pdf")

16 bit multiplier is implemented using hardware.<br>To implement 32 bit multiplier, that will need to be done using software in conjuction with the hardware 16 bit multiplier
